Long Way Lyrics[Verse 1]\nDon't think I've ever seen your kind of pretty\nWandering around this midnight mad house city\nYou got a look that says you've got it all together\nSo if you don't mind, I'd like to know you better\n\n[Chorus]\nTake me the long way around your town\nWere you the queen with the silver crown?\nI want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath\nOf the diamond I think I just found\nTake me the long way around\n[Verse 2]\nI'd love to see just where your daddy met your momma\nYour hand-me-down '99 Impala\nShow me the field you danced in Clover\nThe harvest in October\nWhen the leaves fall from the sky just like a Sunday drive\n\n[Chorus]\nTake me the long way around your town\nWere you the queen with the silver crown?\nI want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath\nOf the diamond I think I just found\nTake me the long way around\n\n[Bridge]\nDidn't think tonight when I walked in\nI'd be falling for somewhere I've never been\n\n[Chorus]\nTake me the long way around your town\nWere you the queen with the silver crown?\nI want your red blushing stories\nYour faults and your glories\nThat made you who you are right now\nTake me the long way around\nTake me the long way aroundYou might also like2Embed", "song_name": "The Long Way"}, {"artist": "Sugarland Featuring Taylor Swift", "lyrics": "Babe Lyrics[Verse 1: Sugarland]\nWhat a
