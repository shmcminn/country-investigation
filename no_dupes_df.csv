Morgan Wallen,"Wasted on You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't always wake up in the mornin'
Pour myself a strong one
Although when I get lonely I do
Your memory gets burnin'
Lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you

[Pre-Chorus]
Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
It's all my fault
Yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all I've wasted on you
[Chorus]
All of this time and all of this money
All of the these sorries I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I swore this one'd be different
My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learning the hard way again
That's why I've been wasted on you

[Chorus]
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

[Bridge]
Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back
Right down to the flame of this match

Yeah, I've been throwin' down the whiskey
I ought to get my money back

She asked me where I's from
I said ""Somewhere you've never been to
Little town outside of Knoxville""
Hiddin' by some dogwood trees
She tried talkin' with my accent
We held hands and waded into
That blue water
She left her flip-flops by my Red Wings on the beach

[Chorus]
Yeah, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed mе tells me she'd lovе Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots
[Verse 2]
I said ""Let's go shoot tequila""
So we walked back to that beach bar
She said ""Don't cowboys drink whiskey?"" (Huh)
So we drank bottom shelf
She said ""Damn, that sky looks perfect""
I said ""Girl, you've never seen stars like the ones back home""
And she said ""Maybe I should, see 'em for myself""

Morgan Wallen,"Don’t Think Jesus Lyrics[Verse 1]
Boy gets a guitar and starts writin' songs
'Bout whiskey and women and gettin' too stoned
He got all three at the first show he played
Hometown said, ""I don't think Jesus done it that way""

[Verse 2]
Boy moves to city, lives fast and goes hard
Starts chasin' the devil through honky-tonk bars
Ignorin' the voices in his head that say
""I don't think Jesus done it this way""

If I was Him I'd say, ""To hell with you, ain't no helpin' you”
Find someone else to give Heaven to, I'm tellin' you
I'd shame me, I'd blame me, I'd make me pay for my mistakes
But I don't think Jesus does it that way

[Verse 2]
Boy's all alone, got no one to turn to
He figures he'll pray 'cause what else could he do?

Morgan Wallen,"More Than My Hometown Lyrics[Verse 1]
Girl, our mamas are best friends and so are we
The whole town's rooting for us like the home team
Most likely to settle down
Plant a few roots real deep and let 'em grow
But we can't stop this real world from spinnin' us
Your bright lights called, I don't blame you for pickin' up
Your big dream bags are all packed up and ready to go
But I just need you to know

[Chorus]
That I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls 'round, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown
[Verse 2]
I ain't the runaway kind, I can't change that
My heart's stuck in these streets like the train tracks
City sky ain't the same black
Ain't that a map dot shame, man, to think that

Yeah, you got a wild in your eyes that I just wasn't born with
I'm a same gas station cup of coffee in the mornin'
I need a house on the hill, girl, not in 'em
So hang onto these words 'til them avenues help you forget 'em

'Cause I love you more than a California sunset
I love you more in a twenty-dollar sundress
Hate that loaded down car you got your keys in
Girl, but I hate even more that you're leavin'

Yeah, you used to talk about
Getting even further South
Somewhere where the summer lasted all year 'round
Probably got a big ol' diamond on your hand right now
Maybe a baby or a couple by now
Long driveway to a big white house

[Chorus]
But I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then, you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?

Yeah, I bet your daddy's so proud
Of how his little girl turned out

Bought a few acres, couple roads off the highway
Guess you never saw things my way anyway

The way I talk, I guess I got it from my pops
Product of some kneelin' down
In a town where the doors don't lock
And there's a million other people like me
From a scene a little more podunk than pop
I didn't choose being born in the sticks
And I'll be damned if I sound like something I ain't
For some folks, a backroad gets old
But for me, it just can't

'Cause I'm from a small town, southern drawl crowd

Still kickin' up some dust behind the tires

Catch a little air when we cross the tracks

I heard you got as far as Santa Fe

I'm just on your radio

I found myself in this bar
Makin' mistakes and makin’ new friends
I was growin' up and nothing made sense
Buzzin' all night like neon in the dark
I found myself in this

[Verse 1]
Couldn’t wait to turn 21
The day I did, I got too drunk
Spin around dizzy on the patio
Found out real quick how to take it slow
Got whiskey bent on whiskey sours
Ran my mouth to an out-of-towner
Learned a big lesson when I met the bouncer
[Chorus]
I found myself in this bar
Makin' mistakes and makin' new friends
I was growin' up and nothing made sense

[Verse 2]
Saw her in the corner sippin' something tall
Cracked a few jokes, we hit off
Get down the road I'm watching her
Walk through the door with some new jerk
And we had it good, and it hurts so bad
But I had to stand my ground
Chased my pride with another round

Morgan Wallen,"Cover Me Up Lyrics[Verse 1]
A heart on a run keeps a hand on a gun
Can't trust anyone
I was so sure what I needed was more
Tried to shoot out the sun
The days when we raged, we flew off the page
Such damage was done
But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
I was meant for someone

[Chorus]
So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good
[Verse 2]
I put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress
In Richmond on High
I sobered up, I swore off that stuff
Forever this time
And the old lover's sing, “I thought it'd be me
Who helped him get home”
But home was a dream, one that I'd never seen
'Til you came along

[Chorus]
So, girl, hang your dress out to dry, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til Percy Priest breaks open wide and the river runs through
And carries this house on its Stones like a piece of driftwood

Someone asked me once in an interview
""What was growing up like?""
""Where'd you go to school?""
""And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?""
I'd be drivin' my first car, an old worn-out Dodge
Tryin' to make rent with a dead-end job, just makin' due
With tips in a jar, my guitar, and an old barstool

[Chorus]
I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this
[Verse 2]
I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day
Who was burnin' CD's just to give away
Payin' his dues
If I wasn't doin' this
Five deep in a van, head full of steam
Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true
Livin' this life just like I was born to do

I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band

A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five

Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes

With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would

Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel

Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill

Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house

And the crickets hum their tune
That's usually about the time
That I feel most alive

And the whole world seems so sad
I ain't had much else going on
So I sat down and wrote this song

Miss the road, I miss my band

But there'll be crowds and there'll be shows
And there will be light after dark
Some day when we aren't six feet apart

Slide on in some corner booth
And take the whole damn family out

How much can a southern girl honestly endure?
Remember northwest mountains, they were snow-capped in June
You were napping on my arms on a Sunday afternoon
But, babe, I've gotta heal myself from the things I've never felt
Repression is my heaven but I'd rather go through hell

[Chorus]
It's 'bout time that I left Austin
'Bout time you settled down
With a man who doesn't move as quick
As the train rolling through town
'Bout time that I face
The hard times I've let go
If love was just an ocean
I would drown before I float
[Verse 2]
You remember getting drunk on the outskirts of this town
When I gave you all I had, but it still let you down?
Everyone I've ever loved has either left or died
Wish I was born with concrete shoes, but I'm leaving tonight

[Chorus]
It's 'bout time that I left Austin
'Bout time you settled down
With a man who doesn't move as quick
As the trains rolling through town
'Bout time that I face
The hard times I've let go
If love was just an ocean
I would drown before I float

[Post-Chorus]

She was in a circle of girls, chasin' a shot with a lime

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

Would you have me? Would you want me?

Sittin' down by the creek
Our lines in the water, watching those bobbers
Seein' that red sun sink
Mama's on the porch yelling ""Supper's hot
Y'all come and get it!""
We yelled five more minutes

Standin' at her front door

But we needed just a little more
Yellow light flipping on and off
Interruptin' that goodnight kissing
We wanted five more minutes

Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh, but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those, Lord knows I'd hit it
And give myself five more minutes

And walked to the fifty-yard line
It's just the coach and me after we
Lost state, ten to nine
And I cried, ""Man next time to get in here
I'll have to buy a ticket""
Can't you give me five more minutes?

[Chorus]
Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh, but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those, Lord knows I'd hit it
And give myself five more minutes

A couple bad demos on a burned CD

Hadn't heard the sound of a door slam yet

Got my ass kicked tryin' to compete with

But everybody else said, ""Man, you're twenty-two
Whatcha trying to prove? Hey, why don't you wait?""
'Cause I've been waiting on her since the second grade, yeah
And now she got her own set of fans
She got a blue check mark by her Instagram
And I wrote a little song about holding her hand
And now everybody wanna die a happy man

""You're gonna have a grandkid, yep
From Uganda, that's right, we're adopting
And she is the cutest little girl that you've ever seen""
Well, I was wrapping my head around being a dad
A big wrench got thrown in the plans we thought we had
Now Lauren's showing, got one on the way
Yeah that's two under two, hey, what can I say?

It was the 14th of October
Had that t-shirt off your shoulder
I was drunk, said I was sober
And you said yeah right
We were talkin’ for a minute
Then some guy tried to cut in
You took my hand and we pretended
Like I was your guy

Oh, then I tried to guess your middle name
For 30 minutes bet we played that game

And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do
From your blue jeans to your shoes

We were dancin’, we were buzzin’
Takin’ shots like it was nothin’
Did the runnin’ man, you loved it
Yeah, you laughed out loud
You brushed away your blonde hair
And you kissed me out of nowhere
I can still show you the spot
Where everything went down

Big iron hips with the holsters

You accidentally bring him to the wedding, whoops

Eric Church,"Some of It Lyrics[Verse 1]
Beer don't keep, love's not cheap
And trucks don't wreck themselves
Mama ain't a shrink, daddy ain't a bank
And God ain't a wishin' well
Money ain't rich, everybody sins
And nobody wins in a fight
And sometimes wrong is right

[Chorus]
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's somethin' to some of it
[Verse 2]
Girls like to laugh, tears don't last
And scared's what praying's for
If it's close, swing the bat, everybody's got a past
And love's worth livin' for
When you dance, hold her close, 'til it breaks, go for broke
Be the first to reach for her hand
No, you don't get to do some things again

[Chorus]
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page

Red leaves on the river
Footprints in the sand
Cold walk in December
Warming up your hands
Sun dress on the front steps
Sun up by the lake
Blanket down in the backyard
Lying wide awake

[Chorus]
That's a memory I don't mess with
The girl I was the best with
The one I was obsessed with

Gotta leave us where we left it

That maybe you called when I was out
But you didn't know what to say, so you didn't leave a message

Her kisses taste like whiskey
Burning through my veins
She don't know how to miss me
She hits right where she aims
Baby's got my number and she's calling me up
Knows what she's doing with a single touch

[Chorus]
She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes, I think she must get off
On turning me on, turning me on

Knows how to set me on fire
She's always holding the match
And when my body's beside hers
There ain't no turning back

Lighting up the room in the world just like

Daddy drove the wheels off a flatbed Ford
Flies found a hole in the old screen door
Granny said the dress that my sister wore
To church wasn't long enough
Mama poured grease in a Crisco can
Put a hundred thousand miles on a Sears box fan
Uncle Joe put tobacco on my hand
Where them yellow jackets torn me up
And I ain't making this up

Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life

You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it

Granddaddy smoked Salems with the windows up
Drove me around in the back of that truck
We drank from the hose and spit in the cup
We all survived somehow

Wouldn't dream of spending that two dollar bill
From pushing a lawn mower around
I'd go back there right now

So I stopped off at a Texaco, bought a Slim Jim and a coke
Parked out by the water just to watch that river flow
Grabbed my guitar from the back seat, wrote a song just for me
And I sung it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees
I thought of home, grabbed my phone from my pocket
And I called mama

It rang a couple times, and she picked up
I can always hear her smile when I call
I just called to tell you that I loved you
I was missing you and dad and home, that's all

About what's important

And a dirty t-shirt that said ""Roll Tide""

Tonka trucks and G.I. Joes
Jumping those hills with Luke and Bo
Plastic cap guns and a swimming hole
Don't get no dirt on your church clothes
Win or lose, we cheer for the Braves
Ten percent in the offering plate
Sunday chicken and a NASCAR race
Sure'd be nice to get back to that place

[Chorus]
There was dirt on daddy's clothes
From putting that bacon on mama's stove
Dog barking in the yard at a truck we don't know
All we had was us
And that little bitty house and a lotta love
We had it all when we didn't have much

Eighteen, left it all behind
Chasing a girl, chasing a dime
Went so far tryna get mine
I can't see that old porch light
That led me home at night

Saw the man in black, spotlight in the air
Heard a thousand screams, I saw my daddy stare
Feel like I've been runnin' since the day that I was born
Eagle on my back, phoenix on my arm

[Chorus]
This goes out to the drifters
And all of the dreamers ready to fly
All those born to be rockstars
Lifting their guitars and painting the sky
Can you hear me?
All of you lost ones who aren't really lost ones
Keep shining your light
This goes out to the wildcards and all of the wild hearts
Just like mine

Now listen
Has anyone ever told you, you'll never amount to anything?
You're just wastin' your time chasin' the tail of a dragon kind of dream
But I'm here to tell you anything can happen in this life
If you got that heart and the passion and a God lit fire inside

We were just a couple years short of the age
By my name on a fake ID
And still 'bout a hundred away from the day
Your daddy said you could run with me
We were a couple of line steppers
Who just couldn’t wait to step over the line
Never thinkin' we wouldn't last
I was your first and you were mine

[Chorus]
And we were leather jackets hangin’ onto a Harley
Two heartbeats in the moonlight
We were both feet hangin' out over the edge
Of the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Mm-hmm
[Verse 2]
We were gonna make it, weren't we, baby?
Had it all laid out in our mind
By the time we knew time was runnin' out
We'd done run out of time
And we were downtown Saturday night, last-call cover band
'Til the last song played, never thought we'd fade
Like the stamp on the back of her hand

[Chorus]
We were her on my shoulders, lighter in the air
""Pour Some Sugar On Me""
We were a top down at Johnson’s field
When she whispered that she wants me
At least there’s a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Oh, mm-hmm

People talkin' ’bout what is and what ain’t country
What gives ’em the right to wear a pair of beat-up boots?

Or a plowboy waitin’ on the rain
We’re all a little different, but we’re all the same

On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through the Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

Did it come from your daddy and mama?
Were you converted by an Alabama song on the radio?
That feels so right
Did you lock eyes with a little green-eyed girl from Jackson?
Tell me what got ya, I just gotta know

[Chorus 2]
Me, I got my Sunday learning in a live oak church
Silver Queen corn in a backyard dirt
Waiting for the fall to finally come along
So I can grab my gun and get my outside on
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I can't judge

Do you wear it on your sleeve or keep it deep down?

On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through them Georgia pines

Luke Bryan,"Most People Are Good Lyrics[Verse 1]
I believe kids oughta stay kids as long as they can
Turn off the screen, go climb a tree, get dirt on their hands
I believe we gotta forgive and make amends
'Cause nobody gets a second chance to make new old friends
I believe in working hard for what you've got
Even if it don't add up to a hell of a lot

[Chorus]
I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half
As bad as it looks
I believe most people are good
[Verse 2]
I believe them streets of gold are worth the work
But I'd still wanna go even if they were paved in dirt
I believe that youth is spent well on the young
'Cause wisdom in your teens would be a lot less fun
I believe if you just go by the nightly news
Your faith in all mankind would be the first thing you lose

[Chorus]

He had me paint it that summer sophomore year
Said I could stay for free

And headed straight for the pier

A little PacSun underneath
Who knew it was 'bout to be

I turned those shutters the color of your eyes
'Til the day turned into night
And took turns with a jar
Turn that boat dock into a bar

And watched all of our friends pair off with one another
But we felt like the stars we were under
And everybody knew that that was our summer

And threw it in a blender with ice
I was more messed up than I cared to be
Spent a whole lot of lonely nights

It was hard to get up, but I put one foot

And some money for a new screen door
Your dad's probably glad to be rid of me
But that ain't me anymore

With my t-shirt on and a half drunk smile

Taylor Swift Featuring Chris Stapleton,"TranslationsTürkçeEnglishPortuguêsفارسیI Bet You Think About Me (Taylor’s Version) [From the Vault] Lyrics[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift]
You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills

[Verse 4: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
Mr. Superior Thinkin'
Do you have all the space that you need?
I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy

Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free
Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me

My thoughts get drowned until I feel alright
And I keep drinkin' 'til I'm someone I don't recognize
I got wasted

My thoughts get drowned until I feel alright
I keep drinkin' 'til I'm someone I don't recognize

Repeat the cycle every day, I gotta start with a drink
My life been getting sorta crazy and I don't wanna think
I look myself right in the mirror and I don't even blink
Then I get angry, take the rest and pour it right in the sink
I know where this road goes
Alcohol ain't my friend, but I keep drinkin' 'cause these demons roam
And follow me 'round everywhere I go
It clouds my mind and soul, it turns my heart cold
But I keep drinkin' 'cause it makes me feel like I'm not alone
I'm havin' problems, my pride won't let me reach out
Lookin' at this bottle, havin' nothin' but doubt
Don't wanna drink, but it keeps comin' around and around and around

I got wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal with myself tonight

I know I need to quit (I need to quit)
I gotta do better (I gotta do better)
Example to these kids (Example to these kids)
'Cause they watchin' when I'm in there, but I'm scared
'Cause I've been chasin' the man that I am when I start to drink
He's cocky, confident and he don't give a damn what you think
This world is beatin' me down, it has pushed me right to the brink
I take a shot every time because man it helps me escape
I'm takin' care of these people, but no one takes care of me
I wanna talk to somebody, but I feel no one relates
I need better now, I think I've lost my way
I'm havin' battles with faith, it's painted right on my face
I hope better times are comin', no chase but I'm still runnin'

I got turned around in some little town
I'd never been to before
Workin' my way through a middle of June
Midnight thunderstorm
There was somethin' in the headlights
That stopped me on a dime
Well, she was scared to death
So I said, ""Climb in,"" and in she climbed
Oh, yeah
[Verse 2: HARDY]
Well, she was bruised and broke from head to toe
With a tear in her blood-stained shirt
She didn't tell the whole truth, but she didn't have to
I knew what had happenеd to her
I didn't load her down with questions
That girl had been through еnough
I just threw it in drive, looked in those eyes
And asked her where he was

[Chorus: Lainey Wilson, HARDY & Lainey Wilson]
I don't know if he's an angel
'Cause angels don't do what he did
He was hellbent to find the man behind
All the whiskey scars I hid
I never thought my day of justice
Would come from a judge under his seat
But I knew right then I'd never get hit again when he said to me
""Wait in the truck
Just wait in the truck""

[Verse 3: HARDY]
Well, I knocked and knocked and no one came
So I kicked in his double-wide door
I let the hammer drop before he got
To that 12 he was reachin' for
I didn't try to hide my pistol
I didn't even try to run
I just sat on the porch, smokin' one of his cigarettes
And waited for the cops to come

There's an old route two-lane
Taking out past where the radio just can't
Pass a riverbed with a rope swing
And a mailbox painted all John Deere green

Out here doing our own thing

Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Keith Urban]
I don't remember much about last night
Woke up on a couch sun-rise
Saw the living room
Through these bloodshot eyes of mine, cold sober
You didn’t like that I came home late
4 AM but it's a Friday, babe
And I've been working hard
Can't you give me some space 'stead of shouting out, ""Oh my God""?

Oh-oh, ooh-yeah
Oh-oh, ooh-yeah
I go out with some new friends
But it just makes me miss you more, more

[Chorus: Keith Urban & P!nk]
I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah
In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone
And I keep second guessing, where did I go wrong?
I know I'm proud
But I've had one too many
Come take me home

[Verse 2: P!nk]
So now I'm the one that's crying
I didn't wanna call 'cause I didn't wanna fight
I swear that I was trying, yeah
But everybody falls when their head's a little high
And I've never meant to get so out my mind
With you playing cool, just pretending it's fine
Oh, we've been 'round, 'round, 'round this
Too many times before

My buddies think I'm on the lake
Boss thinks I've been sick for days
And mama's probably on her way
'Cause I ain't picked up the phone

I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone

Took a trip down memory lane
Checked into hotel heartbreak
Passed rock bottom on the way

This mornin' I got up at 6:01
I walked out and saw the rising sun
And I drank it in like whiskey
I saw a tree I've seen a thousand times
A bird on a branch and I watched it fly away in the wind
And it hit me
It's a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear

Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest
Sometimes it's just beatin'
Some days you just forget
What all you've been given
Some days you just get by
And some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'

I went back in and fired the coffee up
She walked in the kitchen like she always does
In my t-shirt and it killed me
And I kissed her like it was the first time
She laughed and looked at me like I'd lost my mind
I said ""Baby, I love you, can't live without you, I know I don't say it enough""

You don't want to be a rumor, girl, and I feel just the same
Yeah, I know that you don't know me well but we can make that change

When was the last time you did something for the first time?

Say you never drank from the bottle of some two dollar wine, run barefoot through the mud
Never had the right kiss stolen from your lips, while you watched the sun come up
Well, I know your friends are watching and they probably disapprove

Right when I was just getting good and gone?

You could've stayed with the guys, acting like you didn't see me
I would've hurt a little less if you bought some girl a drink

Likes coffee with her sugar in the morning
She likes to leave little red lipstick love notes on the mirror
Loves the rain on a tin roof when it's pouring

Burnin' into a two beer buzz

She told me she was lonely and it would be alright
If happy ever after only meant one night
So, we saddled up in satin and rode off for the mornin' sun
Oh, but somewhere 'tween the neon and the mornin' skies
I saw that I was fallin' for those deep blue eyes
And I couldn't help but wonder, ""Could this woman be the one?""

[Pre-Chorus]
Then it came to the leavin' part
When sleepin' beauty nearly had my heart
[Chorus]
But a cowboy's always got somewhere to go
Another song to sing, another day to save, another rodeo
They're always leavin' town, chasin' sunsets down, it ain't nothin' new
Yeah, they're just passin' through, that's what cowboys do

[Verse 2]
I knew that I was in for one hell of a ride
As I drew a bull so cruel they call him Satan's Pride
And the odds of gettin' even started seemin' mighty thin
So, I gave the nod and everybody held on tight
Went dancin' with the devil on a Friday night
Whenever you're in Texas, the cowboy's gonna always win

Hey mama, how do you get a red wine stain
Out of your favorite dress?
Black mascara off a pillowcase?
Cure a one-too-many headache?
Mama, can I come and maybe stay a few days
This weekend or next?
And hey, how do you get a red wine stain
Out of your favorite dress?

To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard

Can you ask Daddy if he's got time
To come and look at my front door?
It got slammed last night
And now it don't close right
And just promise that you won't tell him everything
And keep that pistol in the drawer
Mama, please don't say
I'm gonna laugh about this someday
You didn't see the way he drove away

I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week

But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

But it does to me

I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back
But I'm okay with that

The day the love of his life said ""I do"" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech
And that might not mean much to you

[Bridge]
If I had it my way, this ol' highway would have fixed me up somehow
Would have led me home by now

[Chorus]
I've been from Savannah to Long Beach
Trying to keep your memory out of reach
But there you were in the Delta nights
The Santa Fe sun, the Colorado sky
I could add another push pin to the map
But that don't stop me from missing you and looking back
Guess there's just one place I haven't gone

I've never been one to ask for help
If I need a mountain moved, I move it myself
I ain't the church pew regular, twice on Sunday
Quote you the scripture kind
I'm far from a preacher
But I'm a believer

[Chorus 1]
'Cause every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed
On the highway to hell, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you
[Verse 2]
For someone to love me like you do
Graceful eyes to see me through
A smile that steals me, a heart that heals me
A touch that kills me too
And baby, you're perfect, I guess the good Lord heard it

[Chorus 1]
'Cause every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed
On the highway to hell, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James

It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you

[Chorus 2]
Every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every tail light fade in the goodbye rain
Girl, even today, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to

Done
The first time I saw you, done
By the first dance was through, I was done
That one kiss I knew
There was nothing I wouldn't do just to give you

Every last breath 'til the last star is counted

Couple cover charge stamps got her hand looking like a rainbow
In and out of every bar on a whim just like the wind blows
She's either a bachelorette or coming off a breakup
Take a drunk girl home

Singing every word she never knew
Dancing with her eyes closed like she's the only one in the room
Her hair's a perfect mess, falling out of that dress
Take a drunk girl home
[Chorus]
Take a drunk girl home
Let her sleep all alone
Leave her keys on the counter your number by the phone
Pick up her life she threw on the floor
Leave the hall lights on walk out and lock the door
That's how she knows the difference between a boy and man
Take a drunk girl home

[Verse 2]
You leave her drive for a dive and you get something bad to eat
They're singing ""Closing Time"" at that little bar across the street
In two by twos, strangers and lovers headed for the covers, hooking up
That TV in your two bedroom sounds turned off
And through the paper-thin walls, you can hear the neighbor’s cigarette cough
There's a million things you could be doing, but there's one thing you're damn sure glad you did

Cheering for the Cowboys

And she's taught to fear the Bible
But she's got a couple friends that she runs around with

Once I get some money, it'll all be easy
But then you get that money, you still feel broke

I can make it anywhere I want, just wait
But I can see it right now, sittin' in my driveway

Has it really been this long?
Two years and an ocean between us
And I don’t know where it all went wrong
I know I coulda kissed you harder
And yeah, you coulda followed through
Shoulda talked a little bit softer
But we meant every ""I love you""

But it feels like we’ve got unfinished business

Just before our love was out of reach
Coulda been enough, coulda saved us from this loneliness

Sometimes her jacket smells like cigarettes
But she hates to smoke
And when I ask her who she's hangin' out with

Clothesline, sunsets

And miles and miles of John Deere green

That's who I am and I'll always be

Out there where the creek bends

The only way I wanna be
Somewhere where the road ends
Out there where the creek bends
That's where you can find me (Find me)
With them fields of gold and cotton rows
That never ending sky
I take it slow and easy roaming this life
Caught up in the country (I was brought up in it)
Caught up in the country (Oh and good Lord willin')

George Strait,"Every Little Honky Tonk Bar Lyrics[Verse 1]
Whiskey is the gasoline that lights the fire that burns the bridge
Ice creates the water that's no longer runnin' under it
Stool holds the fool that pours the whiskey on his broken heart
Cigarettes create the smoke that hides the lonesome in his eyes
The jukebox plays Hank, ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry""
Dance floor holds the folks trying to forget who they are
And that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar

[Chorus]
Friday night, it's a given
I'll be L-I-V-N, livin'
We'll dance on the bar 'til we're sleeping it off in the car
Monday morning, it's a given
I'll be D-R-A-G-N, draggin'
And that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar
[Verse 2]
Neon lights flashing bright 'til you're almost hypnotized
Waitress, short skirt, gets hit on by every guy
Comin' and goin', always rollin' with the flow
Bartender, pour our drinks; Código, do a shot
You think you're tall and bulletproof
Until somebody says you're not
You step outside thinkin' you're gonna show 'em you are
And that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar

When it rains, it pours
But you didn't even notice
It ain't rainin' anymore
It's hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of stayin' above the risin' water line

[Chorus]
Well, the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head

You'd be blinded by the colors
Yellow, red, and orange, and green
And at least a million others
So tie up the boat, take off your coat

Sometimes you gotta drink about somebody
But that ain't goin' bring 'em back
Sometimes you gotta cry and miss somebody
Yea, we've all felt like that
If it's something that you gotta get over, but you just can't get over

[Chorus]
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
In the back of a cab or on a subway train
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
On a midnight street in the summer rain
If you're wishing you were with somebody
‘Cause you don’t wanna go home when it’s closin’ time
If you wanna kiss somebody
Baby, I got somebody in mind
You can kiss like your heart ain’t ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
I know just what you’re goin’ through
‘Cause I wanna kiss somebody too
Kiss somebody like you, I wanna kiss somebody like you

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you try to fix somebody
Just to find out they’ll never change
So you go out and meet somebody
That makes you feel the way you thought you’d never feel again

Tenille Townes,"Somebody’s Daughter Lyrics[Verse 1]
I drive home the same way, two left turns off the interstate
And she's always standing at the stoplight on 18th Street
She could be a Sarah, she could be an Emily
An Olivia, maybe Cassidy
With the shaky hands on the cardboard sign
And she's lookin' at me

[Chorus]
Bet she was somebody's best friend laughing
Back when she was somebody's sister
Countin' change at the lemonade stand
Probably somebody's high school first kiss
Dancin' in a gym where the kids all talk about someday plans
Now this light'll turn green and I'll hand her a couple dollars
And I'll wonder if she got lost or they forgot her
She's somebody's daughter
Somebody's daughter
Somebody's daughter
[Verse 2]
Did she give up wondering where the cars all go?
And can she even tell that I don't know what to say?
So I just nod my head and wave
Well, no one's gonna ask what she wants to be
Or why we're both stuck here at the mercy of geography
And whether it shines or rains

[Chorus]
Bet she was somebody's best friend laughing
Back when she was somebody's sister
Countin' change at the lemonade stand
Probably somebody's high school first kiss
Dancin' in a gym where the kids all talk about someday plans
Now this light'll turn green and I'll hand her a couple dollars
Oh, and I'll wonder how she fell and no one caught her

I'm over dodging this crush
I'm sick of waiting 10 minutes just text you back
So you don't get to thinking that I'm too attached

There's a difference between “Miss you” and “I miss your face”
There's a difference in “What's going on?” and “Baby, how was your day?”

There's a difference in “Love ya” and “I love you”
And I wanna be the difference
Yeah, I do

I wanna be the difference between “Hey, what's up?” and “What we gonna do tonight?”
Between ""Yeah she's cool, we hang out sometimes"", and ""That girl right there she's mine""

LANCO,"Greatest Love Story Lyrics[Verse 1]
They said I was nothing but a troublemaker
Never up to no good
You were the perfect All-American girl
Wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you was sneaking out your window every night, riding shotgun in my car
We'd go to the river and find us a spot and we probably went a little too far
Just a little too far

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen
[Verse 2]
So you went off to college and I got a job
I was workin' that 9 to 5
Dreamin' of the days when you were in my arms, I had never felt so alive
I spent my days workin', spent my nights drinkin'
Howlin' at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back
No it couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon

[Chorus 2]
When I was gonna be your forever
And you were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better and I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

[Verse 3]
So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure, we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee
And I said
You might also like[Chorus 3]
I'm gonna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better, we could have a real nice life
'Cause I'm what you wanted, you're what I need
So let's meet in between
We are gonna be the greatest love story this town has ever seen

We are gonna be the greatest love story this world has ever seen

County sign says ""follow your dreams""
Westbound train makes the whole town shake

You order a drink, it goes down smooth
Before you can blink, it turns into two
It was just gonna be another night with the boys
Shooting some pool, pickin' a stool and making some noise
Then she walks in and I never dance
Turns into tippin' the band, and taking her hand… ah man

Outta the blue sky, lost in her blue eyes
Yeah, when it happens like that

One look and you never look back

Out of town windows down playing those dashboard drums
